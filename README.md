This is a repository for my PHP course required for my program. 
The objective is to:
	Be proficient in Server side configuration
	Be proficient with server-side language like PHP
	Develop sites in PHP with specific functionalities
	Use PHP to learn objected-oriented programming concepts

Each module is part of either the labs assigned for the course, or major assignments assigned for the course. 

Please do not plagiarize if you're in the same course as me, as I'm using this for a centralized repo to learn git.
